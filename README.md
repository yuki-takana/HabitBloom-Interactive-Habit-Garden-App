## 🌿 How It Works

```
Add a Habit → Water it Daily → Watch it Grow → Bloom at 100%
   🌱              💧              🌿              🌸
```

1. **Plant a seed** — create a habit with a name and goal duration
2. **Water daily** — mark it complete each day to build your streak
3. **Watch it grow** — your plant visually evolves through 4 stages
4. **Bloom** — reach 100% of your goal and your plant fully blooms 🌸

  <i>Plant a seed today. Bloom tomorrow.</i>
